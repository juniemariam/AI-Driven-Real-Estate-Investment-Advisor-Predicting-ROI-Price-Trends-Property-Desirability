## 🔍 Data Workflow  

1. **Data Preparation & Cleaning**
   - Extracted ZIP codes, standardized addresses, and computed PITI (principal, interest, tax, insurance).
   - Derived new features like ROI margin, desirability buckets, price per sqft, and mortgage pressure index.

2. **Dataset Integration**
   - Combined:
     - **Education dataset (states_all.csv)** → school quality & expenditure per student.  
     - **Zillow datasets (ZHVI & ZORI)** → home value and rent growth rates by ZIP.  
   - Produced a unified file `/content/DS1+DS2+DS3.csv` with 2,809 rows × 57 columns.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Added ROI ratio, price-to-ZHVI ratio, education spending ratio, and mean test scores.
   - Computed derived indicators like **price_to_edu_spend** and **zhvi_growth_rate**.

4. **Exploratory Visualization**
   - Generated ROI histograms, (PITI + HOA) vs Rent scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.
   - Boxplots and ROI-by-state visualizations (pages 25–34 in the notebook).

5. **Fractal & Golden Clustering**
   - Combined **Euclidean** and **Fractal** distances using:
     \[
     D_f = \alpha D_e + (1 - \alpha) | \text{lfd}_i - \text{lfd}_j |
     \]
     where *lfd* = local fractal dimension.
   - Selected optimal “Golden Clusters” using **silhouette** and **Davies–Bouldin** metrics.

6. **Müller Loop Modeling**
   - Multi-stage automated training for both classification and regression.
   - Ensures consistent re-training and model comparison across DS1 → DS3.

7. **Explainability**
   - **Gini Index** to rank feature importance in Gradient Boosting models.
   - **SHAP** values to explain local feature impacts and visualize global importance.

## 💎 Golden Cluster Findings  

| Dataset | Distance Metric | Golden Cluster | Interpretation |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **DS1** | Euclidean → 2 | High ROI, strong cash-flow properties |
| | Fractal → 0 | Denser subset of same profitable regions |
| **DS1+DS2** | Euclidean → 2 | Consistent ROI with education enrichment |
| | Fractal → 0 | Compact high-ROI pockets in educated states |
| **DS1+DS2+DS3** | Euclidean → 2 | Most profitable, stable ZIPs |
| | Fractal → 0 | Growth-aligned ROI zones with high rent/value increase |

## 📊 Model Performance  

### 🔹 Classification (Müller Loop)

| Dataset | Best Model | Accuracy | F1 | Key Predictors |
|----------|-------------|----------|----|----------------|
| DS1 | Gradient Boosting | 0.98 | 0.979 | HOA, price, mortgage |
| DS1+DS2 | Gradient Boosting | 0.98 | 0.979 | + Education metrics |
| DS1+DS2+DS3 | Gradient Boosting | **0.9857** | **0.9814** | + Zillow rent & home-value growth |

### 🔹 Regression (Müller Loop)

| Horizon | Best Model | R² | Interpretation |
|----------|-------------|----|----------------|
| 1-year | GBR | 0.64–0.99 | Accurate short-term forecasting |
| 2-year | GBR | 0.66 | Stable predictive growth |
| 5-year | GBR | **≈ 0.87** | Strong long-term accuracy |

## 🧮 Feature Importance (Gini Index)

| Rank | Feature | Importance |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | `rent_zestimate` | 0.3279 |
| 2 | `price` | 0.2452 |
| 3 | `monthly_piti` | 0.1629 |
| 4 | `loan_amount` | 0.1403 |
| 5 | `monthly_tax_ins` | 0.0716 |

**Interpretation:** Rent, property price, and loan pressure are the strongest ROI drivers.

---

## 💡 SHAP Explainability  

- **ZIP code**, **HOA**, and **lot size** were key ROI influencers.  
- Positive SHAP values → low HOA & mortgage = high desirability.  
- Negative SHAP values → overpriced or high-loan properties = low ROI.  
- SHAP provided **transparent, data-backed logic** behind each model’s decision.

---

## 📈 Key Insights  

- Fractal clustering exposed **self-similar profitable patterns** across regions.  
- Golden clusters consistently produced **positive rent-to-price ratios**.  
- SHAP confirmed **ZIP-level economics** dominate ROI prediction.  
- Müller loops improved cluster stability by **+15%** and ensured reproducibility.
